You have to add Oracle LDAP. 

click the Address Book button.  Gets a new window.

annoying there's no right click-add new option.  It's under File->New->LDAP Directory 
Settings: 
Name: ldap.oracle.com (just a display name actually) 
Hostname: ldap.oracle.com 
Base DN: dc=oracle,dc=com 
port number: 636 
Bind DN: (leave empty) 
[x] Use secure connection (SSL) [ that is, click it ] 
that should do it.  Perhaps a restart after it's set up will assist.
